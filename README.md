# Twitter Climate Change Stance Analysis

## Introduction

In order to understand how society reacts to activism on climate change, one can try to analyze data in the global town square that is Twitter.

In this project, we pulled 40k tweets published around 3 events related to climate change activism. The tweets were pulled if they included the sentence "climate change".

Then we classified their stances on climate change using GPT-3.5.

This project was originally created for the course [_CS 224C - NLP for Computational Social Sciences - W 2023_](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224c/) at Stanford University.

## Data
